# SiGploit
SiGploit a signaling security testing framework dedicated to Telecom Security professionals and reasearchers to pentest and exploit vulnerabilites in the signaling protocols used in mobile operators regardless of the geneartion being in use.
SiGploit aims to cover all used protocols used in the operators interconnects SS7, GTP (3G), Diameter (4G) or even SIP for IMS and VoLTE infrastructures used in the access layer and SS7 message encapsulation into SIP-T.
Recommendations for each vulnerability will be provided to guide the tester and the operator the steps that should be done to enhance their security posture

SiGploit is developed on several versions

Note: In order to test SS7 attacks, you need to have an SS7 access or you can test in the virtual lab with the provided server sides of the attacks, the used values are provided.

  Version 1: SS7
  -------------
  SiGploit will initially start with SS7 vulnerabilities providing the messages used to test the below attacking scenarios
    A- Location Tracking
    B- Call and SMS Interception
    C- Fraud
  
  Version 2: GTP
  ------------
  This Version will focus on the data roaming attacks that occur on the IPX/GRX interconnects.
  
  Version 3: Diameter
  -----------------
  This Version will focus on the attacks occurring on the LTE roaming interconnects using Diameter as the signaling protocol.
  
  Version 4: SIP
  ------------
  This is Version will be concerned with SIP as the signaling protocol used in the access layer for voice over LTE(VoLTE) and IMS infrastructure.
  Also, SIP will be used to encapsulate SS7 messages (ISUP) to be relayed over VoIP providers to SS7 networks taking advantage of SIP-T protocol, a protocol extension for SIP to provide intercompatability between VoIP and SS7 networks
  
  Version 5: Reporting
  ------------------
  This last Version will introduce the reporting feature. A comprehensive report with the tests done along with the recommendations provided for each vulnerability that has been exploited.
  
    BETA Version of SiGploit will have the Location Tracking attacks of the SS7 phase 1

## Installation and requirements
The requirements for this project are:

    1) Python 2.7
    2) Java version 1.7 +
    3) Linux machine (Windows doesnt support SCTP)

To run use

    cd SigPloit
    
    python sigploit.py
